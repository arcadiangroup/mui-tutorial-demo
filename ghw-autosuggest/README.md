This is an integration of
[autocomplete](https://material-ui.com/demos/autocomplete/)
depicted inside
the Material-UI docs with Github Worlds data.

Instead of using
[react-select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select)
we use
[react-autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest)
in concert with
[Material-UI Tables](https://material-ui.com/demos/tables/)
