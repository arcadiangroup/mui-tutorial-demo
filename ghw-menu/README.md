## ghw-menu

Github Worlds menu is a visualization toolkit that provides
**Views** into JSON data that comes from the
[Github GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/).
It is called Github Worlds **menu** because there is also a
Github Worlds **drawer** which displays the same data and views
but with the
[Drawer](https://material-ui.com/demos/drawers/) being the
primary navigation element instead of the
[Menu](https://material-ui.com/demos/menus/)

This demo is an extension of
[mui-menu](https://github.com/stormasm/mui-tutorial-demo/tree/master/mui-menu) and it is assumed that you have already reviewed the concepts and
documentation associated with that repo.

This is where I will start writing about this repo...
Tomorrow.  Get Excited !!

#### Code Details

The **Admin** functionality was removed from this repo
because it is not used or relevant; but it is
still used and relevant in
[mui-menu](https://github.com/stormasm/mui-tutorial-demo/tree/master/mui-menu#adding-dynamic-routes)
