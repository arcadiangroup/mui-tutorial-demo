## mui-menu

This demo displays a simple example of how to use Material-UI
[menus](https://material-ui.com/demos/menus/) in concert with
[react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
and
[react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux).

This demo displays the same concept as
[mui-drawer](https://github.com/stormasm/mui-tutorial-demo/tree/master/mui-drawer) except the navigation is a function of **menus** instead of
[drawers](https://material-ui.com/demos/drawers/).

### The concept

Each menu item is listed as a section in a book and the chapters in
the book are at the higher level and can be changed at any time
with a drop down menu leaving the sections the same.  You will see
when you get into **Github Worlds** that the menu items are the views
instead of the sections and the chapters are actually the Github
repository you wish to view.  The drop down menu enables one to look at
the same view for different Github repositories and the same is
true for the Chapter / Section analogy inside a book.

Talk about
[react-router-redux](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-redux)

Talk about the Admin functionality, adding keys, how it all works...
