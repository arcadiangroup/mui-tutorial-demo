## Introduction

This demo displays a simple example of how to use Material-UI
[menus](https://material-ui.com/demos/menus/) in concert with
[react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
and
[react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux).

This demo displays the same concept as
[mui-drawer](https://github.com/stormasm/mui-tutorial-demo/tree/master/mui-drawer) except the navigation is a function of **menus** instead of
[drawers](https://material-ui.com/demos/drawers/).

Talk about
[react-router-redux](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-redux)

Talk about the Admin functionality, adding keys, how it all works...
