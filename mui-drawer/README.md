### mui-drawer

The Material-UI docs give an example of using a Drawer to navigate
to different parts of the documentation.  The Drawer code uses
Next.js for its routing.  This demo shows how to use react-router
for its routing instead of Next.js.

For the details on how to refactor the code from Next.js to
Create React App [read these notes](https://github.com/stormasm/mui-tutorial-demo/blob/master/mui-drawer/code.md)
