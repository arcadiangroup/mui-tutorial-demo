**August 02, 2018**

**d2** is the latest version of code that should be run...

d2 matches up with
[v1.4.0](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

This code is finished for awhile, in the future as Material-UI
evolves I will periodically update this code with the latest
versions of the essential files documented below.

I will leave the older versions
in place in their respective directories along with the
associated Readme files for folks are not on the latest
version of Material-UI.

This is the final version of code with the drawer and 3 views...

This code will be migrated over to a new repo with other functionality.

#### Supplemental Concepts

Start out with
[florida-mui](https://github.com/stormasm/florida-mui)
and add in the code from
[mui-card](https://github.com/stormasm/mui-card)
to create the ability to pull json data from different
json files and disply the card data.

Each repository will be equivalent to the chapter in florida-mui.
And each section will be a different view of the data.  One view
might show the avatars, another view may not, another view might
show the number of followers each individual user has and the
other view may not.

The key point is that Chapters relate to repos and Sections relate to views
or different card layouts which use different data points from the json file.

This [Readme](https://github.com/stormasm/florida-mui/blob/master/README.md) explains what you need to do to update
to the latest material-ui code base prior to 1.0.
