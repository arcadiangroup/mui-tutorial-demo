### ghw-drawer

Github Worlds drawer is a visualization toolkit that provides
**Views** into JSON data that comes from the
[Github GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/).
It is called Github Worlds **drawer** because there is also a
Github Worlds **menu** which displays the same data and views
but with the
**[Menu](https://material-ui.com/demos/menus/)**
being the primary navigation element instead of the
**[Drawer](https://material-ui.com/demos/drawers/)**

This demo is an extension of
[mui-drawer](https://github.com/stormasm/mui-tutorial-demo/tree/master/mui-drawer) and it is assumed that you have already reviewed the concepts and
documentation associated with that repo.
